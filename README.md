# Elect Bernie Sanders mobile application
This an unofficial open source iOS, Android, and Windows Phone application that aims to help people get informed about the issues, stay up to date on the latest events in their area, and hopefully in some small way contribute to the election of Bernie Sanders as the President of the United States.

We want to make the best application possible and welcome all contributions.  If you see a bug please report it in the Issues section.  If you are software developer and would like to help, you may fork the repository, make changes on a clone of your forked repository, and then create a pull request to have your change considered.

We are in not officially connected to the Bernie Sanders campaign in any way.  If you want to learn about Bernie Sanders your best resource will always be https://berniesanders.com/
